# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

> You are given two `non-empty` linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in `reverse order`, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
> You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example 1:
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```
