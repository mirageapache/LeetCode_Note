# [0009. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

## 題目描述：

> Given an integer x, return true if x is a `**palindrome**`, and false otherwise.

> 給定一個數字 x ，判斷 x 是否為 `廻文`。

### Example 1:

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3:
